00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.980
Evaluating web accessibility: resources overview.

2
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.500
Evaluation helps you ensure that your websites

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.820
and applications meet accessibility requirements.

4
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.000
Ideally you evaluate regularly throughout
the design and development process.

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.730
This way you find errors early and avoid costly
repairs later in the process.

6
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.060
The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative, W-A-I, or WAI,

7
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.080
provides free resources to help you with your evaluation.

8
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:41.640
"Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility"
explains how you can do some checks yourself.

9
00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:44.900
Even if you are new to web accessibility and
not technical,

10
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.620
these checks give you a rough idea of the accessibility of any web page.

11
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:57.280
WAI also maintains a "Web Accessibility Evaluation
Tools List" that you can filter.

12
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.820
"Selecting Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools"
explains what tools can and cannot do.

13
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.820
For more experienced evaluators, WAI provides
"WCAG-EM",

14
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.540
the "Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology".

15
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:23.140
The "WCAG-EM Report Tool" helps you record
the findings as you follow the methodology.

16
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.740
To help you better understand how different
users experience your website and applications,

17
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:34.920
WAI provides guidance in "Involving Users
in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility"

18
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.480
and "Involving Users in Evaluating Web Accessibility".

19
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.210
With all these resources, you can learn how to check your website for accessibility and

20
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.299
prioritize the issues you need to address first.

21
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.160
Web accessibility: essential for some, useful for all.

22
00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:06.400
