5
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.460
gives you step-by-step instructions to get

6
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.680
a rough idea of the accessibility of any web page.

7
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.020
For example, a web page from your own website,
from your competitor,

8
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.480
or from suppliers you might want to work with.

9
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.219
It is not a complete evaluation of accessibility.

10
00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.340
More assessment by professionals is needed for a definitive and comprehensive evaluation.

11
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.149
Sometimes doing just a few of these checks can give you an indication of the overall accessibility.

12
00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.570
Some checks are simple.

13
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.039
For example, looking at the title of the web page displayed in the browser window.

14
00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.709
You can do most of the checks using any web browser.

15
00:00:58.709 --> 00:01:03.089
Some checks are easier using an extension for your browser.
